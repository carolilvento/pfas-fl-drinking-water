<h1>How Did ‘Forever Chemicals’ Get ‘Everywhere’</h1>

<i id=attribution>By Carolina Ilvento</i>

<p> Industries have been aware of the risks and health impacts associated with "forever chemicals" since the 1950s, yet comprehensive standards to regulate their use are still pending finalization. The timeline  below traces the journey from the invention of these chemicals to the ongoing endeavors to establish regulations. </p>
<h2>Timeline</h2>
<h5>1940s</h5>
<p>
PFAS, or Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances, were first synthesized during World War II. Their development was primarily motivated by the war effort, as these chemicals exhibited remarkable heat- and water-resistant properties. PFAS compounds were initially created for use in military applications, particularly to resist water and oil in aviation and other military equipment.
</p>
<br>
<hr class="horizontal-line">
<br>
<h5>1950s</h5>
<p>
Following their development during World War II, industrial companies began to find applications for PFAS compounds in consumer products. Both 3M and DuPont were among the first companies to use PFAS in various consumer and industrial goods, including non-stick coatings for cookware, water- and oil-resistant textiles, and in firefighting foams. This marked the beginning of the widespread commercial use of PFAS in consumer products.</p>

<h5>1956</h5>
<p>A pivotal study conducted by 3M revealed that PFAS compounds accumulate in the blood, raising concerns about their persistence in the human body.</p>
<br>
<hr class="horizontal-line">
<br>
<h5>1962</h5>
  <p> Volunteers exposed to PFAS-laced cigarettes experienced extreme health effects known as "polymer fume fever."</p>
<br>
<hr class="horizontal-line">
<br>
<h5>1970s</h5>

<p>DuPont scientists classified PFAS as "highly toxic when inhaled," acknowledging their adverse effects on respiratory health.</p>
<p>3M issued warnings about PFAS's toxicity to fish, indicating their environmental impact.</p>

<p>3M begins to phase out production of PFOS and PFOA.</p>

<br>
<hr class="horizontal-line">
<br>

<h5>1984</h5><p>PFAS contamination was detected in the tap water in Little Hocking, Ohio. Despite this discovery, the local water utility was not alerted, underscoring transparency issues and the lack of public awareness about PFAS pollution.</p>

<br>
<hr class="horizontal-line">
<br>

<h5>1990s</h5>
<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) starts to scrutinize PFAS and their potential health impacts. Meanwhile, the chemical industry continues using PFAS in a wide range of products.</p>
<p>A significant study conducted by 3M identified the risk of testicular cancer associated with exposure to PFOA (C8), a specific PFAS compound.</p>

<h5>1992</h5><p>DuPont's study revealed elevated cancer rates among its workers, shedding light on the health risks faced by individuals exposed to PFAS in occupational settings.</p>
<h5>1997</h5> <p>Further investigations discovered heightened cancer rates among workers at the Parkersburg plant, deepening concerns about the long-term health effects of PFAS exposure.</p>
<h5>1998</h5> <p>3M provided evidence to the EPA regarding PFAS accumulation in blood, contributing crucial data to the growing body of research on PFAS exposure.</p>
<p>In the same year, a 3M animal study demonstrated liver damage resulting from PFAS exposure, providing insights into the potential adverse effects on internal organs.</p>

<br>
<hr class="horizontal-line">
<br>

<h5>2000s</h5>

<p>Growing public concern prompts increased research into PFAS contamination, especially near industrial facilities and military bases where firefighting foams containing PFAS are used.</p>
<br>
<hr class="horizontal-line">
<br>
<h5>2010s </h5>
<p>The EPA issues provisional health advisories for PFOA and PFOS in drinking water, setting combined limits of 400 parts per trillion (ppt).</p>
<p>PFAS contamination gains attention as it affects more communities. The EPA works on establishing regulatory standards and guidelines, leading to the identification of more PFAS compounds beyond PFOA and PFOS.</p>
<h5>2016:</h5> <p>A significant PFAS contamination crisis in Flint, Michigan, draws national attention to the issue.</p>
<br>
<hr class="horizontal-line">
<br>
<h5>2020: </h5><p>The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) requires the U.S. Department of Defense to phase out the use of AFFF firefighting foams containing PFAS.</p>
<h5>2021:</h5> <p>The EPA announces its PFAS Action Plan to address PFAS contamination comprehensively.</p>
<br>
<hr class="horizontal-line">
<br>

<h2><a name="what-has-been-done"></a>What has been done?</h2>
<p>In an ongoing effort to combat the growing concern surrounding PFAS contamination, the EPA has taken steps in progress to regulate and address this issue.</p>

<h3>Proposed National Primary Drinking Water Regulation (NPDWR)</h3>

<p>On March 14, 2023, the EPA unveiled a proposed National Primary Drinking Water Regulation (NPDWR) targeting six PFAS compound. This proposal, which is currently under review, does not mandate immediate actions as its implementation is contingent on the finalization of the regulation, which is anticipated by the end of 2023. If fully realized, the EPA expects this measure to reduce a considerable volume of PFAS-related illnesses.</p>

<h3>Infrastructure funding for PFAS mitigation</h3>

<p>As part of an effort to better regulate emerging water contaminants in drinking water around the country, the EPA and federal government are allocating nearly $2 billion to American states and territories.</p>

<p>Nearly 5% of those funds are going to Florida, amounting to $87.6 million to be distributed to small, rural and disadvantaged communities exposed to contaminants in drinking water systems around the state.</p>

<p>Eligible communities include those with less than 10,000 habitants or those not complying to the state’s affordability criteria taking into consideration the size of the population served by given system. The criteria requires primary drinking water regulation, including treatment and alternative source of water supply.</p>

<p>The funds are being provided to states through EPA’s Emerging Contaminants in Small or Disadvantaged Communities (EC-SDC) Grant Program. The $1.9 billion initiative was announced Feb. 15 as part of US President Joe Biden’s $50 billion three-year plan to strengthen water and wastewater systems around the country.</p>

<h3>Designating PFAS as hazardous substances</h3>

<p>While proposals have been made, PFAS is still not defined as a hazardous substance under EPA standards and there are no drinking water standards set.<p>

<p>On August 26, 2022, the EPA issued a proposal to classify two of the most widely used PFAS compounds — PFOA and PFOS — as hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), commonly known as Superfund.</p>

<p>This is a significant step designed to increase transparency concerning the release of these potentially harmful chemicals, by enforcing increased accountability among those responsible for PFAS contamination toward cleanup efforts.</p>

<h3>EPA's UCMR 5 program: Monitoring PFAS (2023-2025)</h3>

<p>The EPA introduced a rule mandating data collection of PFAS under the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule 5 (UCMR-5). This regulation serves as a crucial tool for gathering data on suspected contaminants in drinking water that lack established health-based standards under the Safe Drinking Water Act.</p>

<p>Published in the Federal Register on December 27, 2021, the ryle  represents a vital effort to monitor drinking water quality. Under UCMR 5, the EPA mandates monitoring for 29 PFAS along with lithium, addressing concerns over emerging contaminants in our drinking water supply.</p>

<p>Sample collection for this comprehensive program commenced in January 2023 and is set to continue through December 2025. The data released thus far accounts for approximately 7% of the total results that the EPA anticipates receiving.</p>

<p>The first report stemming from UCMR 5 was released in July 2023, offering a valuable snapshot of the ongoing efforts to ensure the safety and quality of drinking water.</p>
