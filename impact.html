    <h1>Uncovering ‘Forever Chemicals’: The Human Impact of PFAS Contamination</h1>

    <i id=attribution>By Carolina Ilvento</i>

    <p>A serene coastal area, Brevard County has been reported to have one of the highest concentrations of ‘forever chemicals’ in the nation, which has been linked to a pattern of increased reports of cancer diagnoses.</p>

    <p>Beyond the picturesque Florida beaches and busy skies, Brevard County is also home to Patrick Space Force Base and the Kennedy Space Center. Military bases are known to be large polluters of PFAS — short for per-and poly fluoroalkyl substances​​ — which are used in the firefighting foam discharged during training exercises and emergencies.</p>

    <p>Growing up in Cape Canaveral, just a few miles across the Kennedy Space Center, Stel Bailey was fascinated by astronomy in her childhood. The sound of rockets being launched in the middle of the night would excite her to run out of bed to see them disappear into the sky.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, Bailey feels nauseated upon sounds of those same launches, which nowadays are sole reminders of the cause that sickened her family.</p>

    <p class=quote>“When it goes up in the backyard, all I think about is my father seizing up in his bed, about to die,” she said. “Because he worked right there on Cape Canaveral for many, many years.”</p>

    <p>Bailey’s father was the last of the family’s long ordeal of diagnosis that started in January 2013 when Bailey’s uncle, a life-long resident of Brevard County, passed away due to cancer. Soon after came her brother’s diagnosis, who at the age of 21 had his body <i>“littered in tumors.”</i></p>

    <p>With no history of cancer in the family, Bailey took this as a weird coincidence and bad luck.</p>

    <p>Then, three months later, shortly after giving birth to her daughter at 26 and while having her husband deployed at war, Bailey started feeling extreme symptoms that soon escalated to a diagnosis of her own.</p>

    <p>At this point, Bailey started questioning everything.</p>

    <p>As she went through her journey, she said experts who were unrelated to her case would be fascinated by her diagnosis and constantly ask her questions about radiation and about where she grew up.</p>

    <p class=quote>“I knew something was off,” she said. “I just knew it had to be something environmental.”</p>

    <p>She started crowdsourcing medical data in her area and within a week built a list of hundreds of people reporting unusual medical patterns.</p>

    <p class=quote>“I thought I am on to something here, this is not normal,” she said. “They have normalized it where I've grown up with all these people having all of these illnesses. It shouldn't be normalized.”</p>

    <p>Convinced her disease wasn’t pure casualty, Bailey grew very vocal about her cancer in the community. And as a military family, her story quickly caught the public eye.</p>

    <p class=quote>“He was serving in Afghanistan and his wife is diagnosed with cancer, and he comes home to you know, having to kiss my bald head to just a whole new reality,” she said. “He went from one battle to another battle.”</p>

    <!-- <img src="photo.jpg" alt="Stel Bailey's Photo"> -->

    <p>Within a year, Bailey’s father, brother, uncle and dog were diagnosed with cancer. While fighting her own battle against the disease, she became relentlessly dedicated to finding out what was poisoning her community.</p>

    <p>Bailey worked alongside researchers and oncologists crowdsourcing data to make sense of what she and so many others had experienced in the area.</p>

    <p>They found decades old water quality reports ranking Brevard as one of the worst in the county along with unusually high rates of Hodgikin’s lymphoma in the area, the same cancer her and her brother had been diagnosed with.</p>

    <p class=quote>“When you are going through cancer, you are in fight mode,” she said. “It's not until afterwards that the gravity of what you went through really hits you. It's a battle in itself.”</p>

    <p>As she battled to reach remission in 2014, Bailey discovered relevant and concerning data, but she couldn’t get a clear explanation of what had caused their illness until four years later.</p>

    <p>In 2018, when the Department of Defense published a report indicating high levels of PFAS in groundwater at Patrick Air Force Base and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, reaching up to 4.3 million parts per trillion. The current EPA proposed standard for PFAS is four parts per trillion.</p>

    <p class=quote>“I'll never forget because my family sat in the living room here in Florida watching the segment, and we just cried together,” she said. “It was just this overwhelming feeling of confirmation for us.”</p>

    <p>Later that year, Bailey went from fighting cancer to battling contamination in water. In December 2018, founded Fight for Zero, a non-profit organization with a mission to “fight for zero” contaminants in water, as well as cancer and diseases by preventing harmful environmental exposures.</p>

    <p class=quote>“I believe what I did is I took my trauma, my pain, my horrible memories and I created fuel with it for this work that I'm doing now,” she said.</p>

    <p>Bailey became a national advocate for clean water. Every year she attends conferences around the country and speaks to representatives calling for better regulations and standards. Today, the Fight for Zero has over 60,000 subscribers.</p>

    <p>Through the non-profit, Bailey has gotten the attention of her community members, who had been personally impacted by PFAS but weren’t aware of the cause. Many had ties with the military, and had gotten either sick themselves or watched a family member get diagnosed — likely due to high exposure to PFAS while living close to military sites.</p>

    <p>Jennifer Jackson, was born and raised in Indian Harbour Beach, Brevard County. As a child in the 70s, she remembers feeling sensitive to the water in the area.</p>

    <p class=quote>“I got colds a lot. I was sickly a lot. My skin would react, it would get red, and I would have reactions and itches,” she said. “But as a child, I never equated that to any further connection.”</p>

    <p>As a student at Satellite Beach High School, Jackson saw further rejection from her body to the water, as she noticed she’d get stomach pains anytime she’d drink out of the school’s faucet water. At around this time she also began feeling bone pain.</p>

    <p>At age 19, Jackson was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer. In her battle against cancer, she developed a healthier lifestyle by opting for whole foods — a habit she still attributes to her remission.</p>

    <p>For decades, she didn’t further question the ultimate origin of the cancer she had developed at such a young age.</p>

    <p>But in 2018, Jackson connected with Bailey through Fight for Zero. Having grown up in the same area, they talked about the increased number of cancer cases in the area since Jackson’s diagnosis in 1991.</p>

    <p class=quote>“So many people I went to high school with got skin cancers in their 20s,” she said. “That is not common.”</p>

    <p>After going into remission, Jackson then went on to marry a military fighter pilot. Along with her husband and daughter, she spent decades moving around the country to wherever her husband was stationed. And during nearly 30 years, they never got placed to live on-base.</p>

    <p>Jackson said at the time she didn’t think of a reason for always being placed off-base, but as she learned about PFAS in her hometown and thought about her personal medical record, she wonders if there is a connection.</p>

    <p class=quote>“So I think to myself, military bases know ‘well, we get a lot of chemicals around here, whatever those chemicals are, we keep moving our people,’” she said. “So, you can’t really pinpoint a specific place for exposure.”</p>

    <p>After meeting Bailey, Jackson became an advocate for Fight for Zero, driven by her own experience with cancer and her connection to PFAS contamination. She has dedicated herself to raising awareness about PFAS and pushing for stricter regulations to safeguard public health.</p>

    <p class=quote>“I don't want any other family to go through this,” Bailey said. “We can't just sit back and allow it to keep happening. We've got to make some serious change here that is going to protect our future generations.”</p>
